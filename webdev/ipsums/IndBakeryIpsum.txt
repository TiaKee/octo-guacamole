We have been using our own recipes to bake beautiful cakes, sweets, pastries and bread in store for the last 10 years.

 

We specialise in wedding and celebration cakes. These need to be pre-ordered and as much notice as possible is appreciated. We know you will want to the right cake for your celebration, which is why if you pop into our shop, you can try before you order.

 

We also sell day to day baked goods in our shop from a basic loaf of bread to a naughty little cup cake or pastry. We think it all tastes delicious and we hope you agree.

If you order a celebration cake from us we can deliver for free within 20 miles of our shop. If you require a delivery service please arrange the delivery time and date with us when ordering your cake, especially if it’s a Saturday as we may have a number of wedding and party cakes being created for the same day.

 

If you chose to collect and transport your cake yourself we will box up the cake to ensure the smoothest transition possible and also give you tips on how to carry the boxes and secure them in your car. We don’t recommend transporting cakes on motorbikes or pushbikes!
