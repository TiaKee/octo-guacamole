Welcome to The Place to Learn’s website. We pride ourselves in delivering the best education possible to our students, which is demonstrated through our Outstanding Ofsted inspection and our exam results, which for a third year in a row put us in the top 10 schools and colleges in the country.

 

As well as offering a high quality of teaching and extra-curricular activities to our students, we also have a commitment to ensure that our pupils receive the best pastoral care and support so that they feel happy and safe here and are therefore able to thrive and achieve academically. Our Student Services team are all trained to work with young people and as part of the team we have a Counsellor who specialises in children and young people’s counseling.

 

To see more of what is on offer at The Place to Learn please explore our website further or contact us via the contact details at the top of the page.

 

We look forward to hearing from you.
