Whether you’re after a quick bite at lunch, a chilled out after-work-drink or a big night out, then Our Bar in the place to come. We have a fantastic selection of light snacks and meals on our menu and a drinks list that boasts mouthwatering cocktails of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic varieties, a large range of European lagers and a superb wine selection.

 

Also, if you have a special occasion coming up why not let us take away the hassle of planning and hosting and book our atmospheric basement function room where you can enjoy a private bar and DJ and we will decorate for you and lay on a buffet of a selection of foods from our menu at a price to suit your budget.

 

We look forward to seeing you at Our Bar soon!

We would love to see you at one of our upcoming events!

 

Valentine’s Day Wine Tasting

 

Book a table for two and for an all inclusive price of £65.00 enjoy a set three course meal and sample a range of wines to complement each course.

 

Mother’s Day Lunch

 

Take Mum out for a well deserved treat, either to say thank you for being fab or just to give her a break from cooking. If you book in advance tell us how many Mums will be in your party and we will give them a complimentary gift of a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates.

 

Easter Bunny Bounce

 

Our resident DJs will be playing an eggstra special set on Easter Saturday from 8.30pm – 1am on Easter Sunday morning. Full fancy dress is optional but bunny ears or bunny tails are a requirement to enter the dance floor!
