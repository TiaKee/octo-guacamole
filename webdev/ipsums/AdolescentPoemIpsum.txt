What it’s all about

I used to work for a company with a website for kids. One of the features of the site was a bulletin-board type of thing, where kids could write in and get “published”. A lot of kids wrote in with poetry. Some of it was actually pretty good. You know, for a 12 year old.

Anyway, I took all their poems, and used them as the input for a program which dissects texts and creates new texts based on the probabilities of words following each other. It’s called “I am” because those are always the first two words of the poem. I had it set up to be more random at first, but I found that I liked the consistency of having the first two words always the same.

I’ve been doing things like this for a while, but so far the kids’ poetry is the best source I’ve found. If you have any comments about this page, I’d love to hear them. Please use the form below.

Jamie Zawinski has a very nice page explaining this sort of thing in more (and more interesting) detail. Check it out.

i am finding
another evil from it that is all
music, to my one and only
love i will swim the longest
ocean. i will dry your
tears. when you left,
not so long ago
there was
never possible, but
only the moon knew. i dreamed about
laying among the sky, faded
souls who’ve turned to see you
again but i
survived! thats
why youre talking to
me!! but its my job to
complain and whine so give me a kiss
and that’s bout’ it so for the
best, the
drooliest can take over
mine. i
think you live
to torcher me i put my
head each night.
i knew i could
fly i’d be insane to ever
let that dirty game recapture
me you told
me it
was i. i can’t stand to be a slave
of love take
thee to the pool she is on the
sleet. you crash,
and fall to the
beach and
laid it in the world of great
concern that
often we do not stop and think of you
makes me have a yearn to give
it’s ours to learn to
treasure it it
will always
become, the perfect
frame for the
record i don’t like you,
it’s all so
amazing, on how everything seems
to yell, my heart isn’t
content my eyes that shine.

nice, they even let you
know what true
love

reading this anymore, and so
do you! presants are

caused a long time i’m sure and what
your thinking of,just to let you
get in it, it’s almost
like playing a game.

there is war in cause of
fights between lands!
i love the other,
a small kind boy, everytime he
is sitting in
class i see her in the
middle of the game
pokemon for 12 hours
(non-stop!) time goes on i
wanna be alone
just let it grow? to
patch it with ease .

i am not i am alone i cry,
when i turn my head. i
think to myself, this is as good as
it all flashes
before me. i still love you loos
your love you :) gentle
butterfly landing on my bed.

when i look up they say is not
he gets on my red
burning hot face when
i am eccentric and
complicated i pretend that i love my mom
and my light
i’ll
love him now i
cannot build a mountain…
or catch a
rainbow fair…

but let me be alone
with my faults? and
therefore not my gifts? my spirits
dwell inside of me.
don’t say she
takes it all
started when we are alone
i cry, when i look
in the
shadow zone
death is the best
of friends our frienship
never ends when i think, i
remeber
everything you
ever had that
special
clique –
that look
that love, but also the
boy just so
fine.
