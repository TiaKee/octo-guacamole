This is how we will work with you:

 

We will have an initial meeting for which there will be no charge.

We will then put together a plan including our recommendations. This plan will include our fees so you can see upfront what you will need to pay.

If you are happy with the plan and the fees we will then put the plan into action.

We will regularly review how things are going in line with the review schedule in the plan.

 

If you would like to arrange an initial meeting please contact us today.
