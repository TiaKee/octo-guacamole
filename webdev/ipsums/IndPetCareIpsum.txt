We are a family business and have always had our own pets. We started our boarding kennels 10 years ago and over the last 5 years have expanded to also offer boarding for cats and smaller animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs and even pets as small as hamsters.

 

We love animals and for the duration of it’s stay your pet will be treated like it’s one of the family. We have 4 acres of land so your dogs will have a lovely time running free and exploring.

 

We will put together a care plan with you for your pet before you leave them so you know they will be looked after just as you would. You can come and visit us as many times as you like before you decide to leave your pet with us, as we know it can be a difficult decision to make and you want to make sure it’s the right one.
