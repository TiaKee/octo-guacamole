We are a friendly team of dentists, hygienists and receptionists who work together to ensure that you receive the best treatment that you require at a time that suits you. All of our dentists are accredited by The British Dental Association Good Practice Scheme, so you can rest assured that your smile really is in good hands.

 

We offer NHS dental treatment to children and have a very easy private payment scheme for our adult patients. We encourage everyone to visit the dentist regularly so that we can prevent any problems from occurring and the more you visit the less likely it is that we will have to do anything “scary”!

Meet our team and see that people who work in dentists really are nice people!

 

Andy the Dentist -

 

Andy qualified 13 years ago and has continued to undertake training and build on his qualifications throughout his years in practice. When he’s not peering into people’s mouths, Andy likes playing badminton, walking the dogs and spending time with his lovely wife.

 

Sandy the Hygienist -

 

Sandy qualified 20 years ago and like Andy enjoys building on her skills by attending training. Sandy has a husband, three children, two dogs, a rabbit and a hamster. We ‘re not sure how she finds time to come to work!

 

James the Dental Nurse -

 

James qualified and joined the team a couple of years ago. He spends his time running, rock climbing, kayaking and swimming (not just when he falls out of the kayak!). He is cool Uncle James to his niece and nephew and brings his experiences with them to his job and is great at reassuring our younger clients that it really is going to be ok.
