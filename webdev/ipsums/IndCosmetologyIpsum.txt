We are Only Hair For You and no matter your age or style we can make you feel fab about your hair.  Whether you want a trim, a completely new style, a change of colour or to go straight or curly we can do that for you. If you’re not sure about what you want then come in for a chat, we can talk through some ideas, look at some pictures and help you choose your next great look.

 

We have a team of stylists who between them have too many years experience to count! Our senior stylist and salon owner has worked in top London salons but prefers to be her own boss and likes the personal feel of running a salon in a small town. She is also specially trained in cutting children’s hair so if you’re apprehensive about your little one having their first hair cut then you know where to come.
