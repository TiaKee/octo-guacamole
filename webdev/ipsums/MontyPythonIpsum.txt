Be quiet! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. How do you know she is a witch? Who's that then?

Well, what do you want? The nose? We found them. The nose? Well, how'd you become king, then?
Burn her anyway!

No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. And the hat. She's a witch! We found them. Well, she turned me into a newt. Camelot!

    You don't vote for kings.
    Did you dress her up like this?
    Why do you think that she is a witch?

Burn her anyway!

Where'd you get the coconuts? Look, my liege! Shut up! Where'd you get the coconuts? Did you dress her up like this?

    And the hat. She's a witch!
    I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
    No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Oh, ow! I am your king.

Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! But you are dressed as one… Well, she turned me into a newt. Camelot!

We found them. How do you know she is a witch? I am your king. The nose?

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

I'm not a witch. We found them. He hasn't got shit all over him. How do you know she is a witch? I dunno. Must be a king. Now, look here, my good man.

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Bloody Peasant!

…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? She looks like one. Where'd you get the coconuts? Who's that then? Listen.
