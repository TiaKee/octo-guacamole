We are a small boutique with a cute little shop on the high street and we are now selling some of our gorgeous stock online. We pride ourselves in our range of items from big name designers, talented young local designers and some vintage items as well to create a truly unique range for our customers to enjoy choosing from.

 

If you order online there will be a delivery charge based on each item. We try to keep this as low as possible by using light packaging but obviously we want your items to arrive in perfect condition so we make sure they are well wrapped.

 

To keep up to date with our offers and sales follow us on Twitter or Facebook and you will be notified in advance of our 20% off days in store and online or our free postage and packaging days online.

Our business only works if we are stocking the items that you want to buy, so we have set up this suggestions page for you to tell us if you think there is anything missing from our stock that you would like to see or whether there are things you would like to see more of.
