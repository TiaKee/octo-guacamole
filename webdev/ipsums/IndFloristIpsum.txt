We are an independent local florist with 30 years experience in the business. We pride ourselves on delivering a personal service and we source our flowers as locally as possible to ensure that they are as fresh as possible when they reach you.

 

We are wedding flower specialists and we have won many awards for our displays and bouquets. We also create floral funeral tributes and gifts for all occasions.

 

All gifts can be delivered directly to the recipient and will be gift boxed and accompanied by a gift card. We can also send balloons, a teddy or a box of chocolates as an additional gift with the flowers, depending on the occasion. As we said, we like to create the experience of receiving some of our flowers as personal and as special as possible.

 

You can place orders via the website or to discuss a more personal gift option please don’t hesitate to give us a call or pop into our little shop in town and choose it all yourself.

We can deliver flowers within 25 miles of our shop between the hours of 9.30am and 5.30pm Monday to Saturday.

 

If you order before midday we can offer a same day delivery service, so nobody will ever know that maybe you hadn’t remembered a special date until the day!

 

If you would like to arrange the delivery of flowers on a Saturday please give us as much notice as possible as it can be a busy day for us, especially at the height of the wedding season.
