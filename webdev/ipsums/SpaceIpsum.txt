Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

Failure is not an option.

We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.

Failure is not an option.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

Failure is not an option.

We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.

Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.

Failure is not an option.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.

When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
