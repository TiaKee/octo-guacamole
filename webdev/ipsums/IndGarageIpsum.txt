Handy Man Mechanics offers everything you need to keep your car in tip top condition and on the road including:

 

    •  Servicing and Repairs
    •  Tyres
    •  MOTs
    •  Car Air Conditioning

 

Not only do we offer all of the above but we make it easy for you to access our services.  We can pick your car up from your home or work and return it to you or, if you give us enough notice, we can give you a courtesy car while we have yours. If it’s a quick job you’re very welcome to wait while it’s done and we’ll throw in a hot drink and if you’re lucky a biscuit!

We offer a wide range of tyres to suit all budgets but before we try to sell you new tyres we will inspect your current tyres to ensure that you actually need new ones – we aren’t in the business of selling you something you don’t need.

 

Once we have fitted new tyres we will give you advice on tyre pressures and tread depth to ensure you stay as safe as possible on the road.
