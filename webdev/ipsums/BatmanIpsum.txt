Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.

It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.

Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

Bane was a member of the League of Shadows. And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul, is not to be trifled with.

Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?

Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da!

You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

Swear to me!

Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.

You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.

Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment.

When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.

I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.

Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

It was a dog. It was a big dog.

You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?

Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!

And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

I thought this might be a good opportunity for... improving the foundations.

Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members in the Wayne family.

The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body or your life. That time is past.

No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.

A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.

Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.

I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

Now choice is yours: exile or death?

You're taller than you look in the tabIoids, Mr. Wayne.

You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.

Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.

No gun? I'm insulted.

You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.

Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent.

I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

Very well. Death! By exile.

My anger outweights my guilt.

Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I'll see him again.

Search him. Then I will kill you.

That's a lovely lovely voice!

No guns, no killing.

Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.

Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.

Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane.

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.

Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.

This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.

Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.

Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.

You must become more than just a man in the mind of you opponent.

There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.

I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.

Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.

They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.

You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.

I got another another job. Your.

You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows.

If you're good at something, never do it for free.

Didn't you get the memo?

I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.

I'm Batman

This isn't a car.

Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.

You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.

Citizens, take control. Take control of your city!

I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.

Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.

Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

I'm not wearing hockey pads.

As Gotham's favored son you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

Do you feel in charge?

Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.

You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger.

Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

It's ends here.

I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.

It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.

Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.

Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?

If you're good at something, never do it for free.

I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.

I'm not wearing hockey pads.

Now choice is yours: exile or death?

Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.

Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

Perhaps you should read the instructions first?

Search him. Then I will kill you.

Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.

If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.

You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

My anger outweights my guilt.

Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger.

I am the League of Shadows.

No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.

Your anger gives you great power. But if you Iet it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.

Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not...

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

That's a lovely lovely voice!

I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.

You must become more than just a man in the mind of you opponent.

Bane was a member of the League of Shadows. And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul, is not to be trifled with.

You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.

Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

You're taller than you look in the tabIoids, Mr. Wayne.

Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.

I just want my phone call.

Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.

I got another another job. Your.

Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.

You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.

Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.

There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones. 

Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?

This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.

I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.

Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

Does it come in black?

What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?

I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?

There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!

No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.

Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

We have purged your fear. You are ready to Iead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.

Do you feel in charge?

Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?

I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.

Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad.

Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.

Now, our operation is small but there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have... tryouts.

Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha. And I thought my jokes were bad.

They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.

The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.

Gordon... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

Very well. Death! By exile.

You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.

You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.

Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.

Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca.

But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.

And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent.
