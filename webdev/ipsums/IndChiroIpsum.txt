We are a small clinic that has been in business for 15 years.  We have 4 treatment rooms and a comfortable waiting area with receptionist. We are a private practice and we treat patients of all ages.

 

If you are planning on visiting us for the first time, please allow 45 minutes for your initial appointment and you will need to arrive 10 minutes before your appointment time to complete some paperwork. Our aim at this initial appointment and any future appointments that may follow, is to identify the problem and start working on it to make you feel better. We will also work with you to identify ways in which you could improve your condition between appointments.

 

We look forward to meeting you and also to sending you on your way again, hopefully with a spring in your step.
